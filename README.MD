# Deep model from scratch (English caption below)
 
## Introduction 

In this project, I am re-implementing commonly used neural networks such as LSTM, RNN, CNN, etc., in typical architectures by using basic libraries like NumPy instead of supported frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. This re-implementation helps me, as well as others, to better understand these neural network architectures and how to effectively implement and deploy them.Secondly, I will experiment with the neural networks I have implemented using some simple tasks and compare their results with networks built using PyTorch.
